# DSCI-6004 Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer Reviews using Transformers

This project utilizes Transformers, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) library, to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
### Overview
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of NLP that aims to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this project, we focus on analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews from Amazon. By utilizing Transformer-based models, specifically pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or RoBERTa, we can leverage their contextual understanding of language to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

### Requirements
  Python 3.x
  
  PyTorch
  
  Transformers
  
  Pandas
  
  NumPy
  
  Matplotlib
  
  Seaborn

### Usage
Data Preparation: Obtain Amazon customer review data. This can be done by scraping Amazon's website or using datasets available on platforms like Kaggle.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding it into a format suitable for input into the Transformer model.

Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained Transformer model suitable for sentiment analysis. Common choices include BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, etc.

Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the selected model on the Amazon customer review dataset. This involves training the model on the labeled data to adapt it to the specific task of sentiment classification.

Evaluation: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on a separate validation set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Inference: Use the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on new, unseen Amazon customer reviews.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, leveraging Transformer-based models for sentiment analysis of Amazon customer reviews showcases their efficacy in understanding nuanced language patterns. Through fine-tuning pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa, accurate sentiment classification is achieved. Despite challenges such as data preprocessing and model selection, the results demonstrate promising accuracy and performance metrics. The ability to extract sentiment from large-scale textual data enables businesses to gain valuable insights into customer opinions, facilitating decision-making processes and improving overall customer satisfaction. Continued research and refinement in this domain hold potential for further enhancing the precision and applicability of sentiment analysis in real-world scenarios.
